# Devlabs Backend

## Gradle wrapper

The backend project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as 
its build tool, but you do not have to install it yourself. 
You can use the gradle wrapper that is included in this 
project.

The wrapper is executed by by running `./gradlew` (Linux/OSX)
or `gradlew` (Windows).  Replace the `gradle` command with
the appropriate wrapper command for your OS to run the 
commands below.
